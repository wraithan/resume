A listing of my less technical skills and development methodologies
that I wasn't sure where else to put.

#####
Agile
#####

I have never worked anywhere that implemented any of the agile
methodologies fully. But I have worked with several of the techniques
found in Scrum and XP, including:

* Pair programming
* Continuous integration
* Sprint based development
* Test driven development
* Collecting and writing user stories

Public Speaking
###############

Public speaking, especially educating a group on a topic is a lot of
fun to me. I hope to speak at some conferences this year after gaining
confidence with the following:

* A couple years of speech and debate when I was in high school.
* Numerous talks at the Portland Python Users Group.
* Slide design and preparation.
