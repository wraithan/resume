About Me
========

I'm your typical hacker--I love learning new things, playing around with the
latest tech, and figuring out how things work.

My passion is building software that makes things simple. There's something
about the process of solving problems in an elegant way that excites me.

Philosophy
##########

My philosophy on software and life is the same: *be agile*. I strongly believe
in learning from mistakes, iterating quickly, and building strength over time. I
understand that big change is made from consistent small efforts, and strive to
continuously improve myself every day.

When I work on things, I strive to give them 100% of my effort. Regardless of
whether I'm folding laundry or writing unit tests, I thoroughly enjoy myself and
constantly push myself to new levels of understanding and efficiency.

Purpose
#######

My main purpose is to make the world an awesome place. I want to solve cool
problems, and help make Earth the `best planet in the universe
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet>`_ :)

To this end, my daily goal is to push myself out of my comfort zone a little
bit every day, and continuously improve. I want to build and create software
that *rocks*.
