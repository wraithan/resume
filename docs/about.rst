About Me
========

I am a social hacker from Portland, OR, USA. A large number of my
evenings are spent hanging out with fellow programmers at cafes or
bars. Commonly discussing our latest and greatest projects over some
nachos.

Why do I hack
#############

Repetition is one of the banes of my existence. The first time I do
something it is new and interesting. The second time I get a feel for
what parts should, could, and probably will be automated. The third
time I am definitely looking for and/or writing something to solve
this problem for me.

There is a lot of great software out there, functionality wise if not
code beauty wise. I find over time instead of building my own unique
projects that provide something that stands on its own, I am gluing
services together in order to make the web a more coherent place.

Finally there is the wonderful micro high that comes along with
solving a problem. It is even better if it was a hard problem or you
have an elegant solution. The best is a really hard problem, really
elegant solution, and being able to show it off to my friends because
it is open source.
