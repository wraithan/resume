My professional work in the software industry over the years:


Aquameta
########
Senior Software Developer (Mar '10 - Feb '12)
*******************************************

This was my most recent job, I loved this company and learned a great
deal while I was working there. It is where I cut my teeth on Django
apps that needed more than just some more hardware thrown at them to
scale.

* Was part of a team that implemented, maintained, and extended a
  large Django application that powered 3 sites.
* Scaled that application using celery for offloading and generous
  amounts of caching.
* Upgraded Django between major versions twice. From 1.1 to 1.2 and
  from 1.2 to 1.3.
* Wrote and encouraged the writing of both unit tests and functional
  tests.
* Wrote and maintained one click deployment scripts using Fabric.
* Interfaced with the clients regularly to gather requirements for
  features.
* Guided the architecture of the application using community best
  practices and past experience.

Parthenon Software
##################
Software Developer (Sept '09 - Nov '09)
*************************************

This was a PHP shop I worked at for a short while. I did development
on a well established code base.

* Updated unit tests, allowing for more confidence that application
  was correct.
* Met with clients to discuss and advise on what course to take for
  re-designing their software.
* Implemented feature requests, fixing existing bugs in the module
  while adding the feature, resulting in cleaner, better documented
  code.
* Participated in “brainstorming” sessions concerning design/testing
  details for various project.

Critical Path Software
######################
QA Tester (May '08 - Aug '08)
***************************

Here I worked in the QA department testing software and hardware. The
primary project I was hired for were 2 lines of computers that a
company was going to release and they wanted some independant stress
testing done in a wide range of activities. Online gaming, word
processing, downloading content, watching HD video both streaming and
off a Blu-Ray.

* Learned to write very effective bug reports.
* Wrote and executed test plans, tracking progress and reporting
  defects.
* Worked with a team to decide on software milestones and
  requirements.
* Set up many different hardware/software configurations for testing.
* Wrote a tool using C++ to generate data for testing.
* Assist in delegation of various portions of testing to help train
  new members of the team prior to product release.


Transim Technology
##################
Intern Software Developer (Dec '05 - Aug '06)
*******************************************

This was my first foray into the world of software development at a
company. The stack was a large java backend with a PHP layer on top
with liberal use of Perl as glue.

* Cleaned up and maintained several in-house tools written in Perl,
  Java, and PHP for processing and displaying circuit schematics.
* Created a GUI for two of the in-house tools so that non-technical
  staff could assist in processing schematics that needed human
  interaction.
* Implemented a secure login system with detailed permission setup.
* Documented all of the above mentioned work, along with a large
  portion of a Java based webserver back-end.

I had a great time at this job and this, on top of my passion I
already had, really sealed the deal as far as my desire to pursue
software development as my career.
