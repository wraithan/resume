This is a hybrid cover letter as I will be applying for two positions
at Mozilla, Web Dev and SDK Engineer.

WebDev: http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/of74Vfw5
SDK Engineer: http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/o8pdWfwq

Greetings Hiring Manager!

I am a Portland, Oregon based software developer with a strong
background in web development. In recent years that has been a lot of
Django. Also, in my free time I have been mixing technologies and
playing with some of the newer things like Node.js and Clojure. I am
applying for this position for a number of reasons, the primary two
being:

  * Everyone I know who works for Mozilla loves their job and the
    people they work with.
  * Open source is near and dear to me and the opportunity to write
    open source software all day every day is very in line with my
    core values.

For the last 3 years I've been writing web applications in Python
using Django. Including developing large sites that required
considerable caching and offloading. Also I work to help support and
maintain Read the Docs, a project Mozilla sponsors, to my delight.

I have used JavaScript as a side effect of being a web developer for
the last 5-6 years. I didn't really gain a passion for it until about
8 months ago when I started using Node.js and I learned how elegant it
can be. Since then I've spent a great deal of time playing with
Node.js as well as newer web JavaScript technologies.

My passion for great, open source, well documented code, as well as my
passion to keep learning and advancing myself as a developer are some
of the main reasons I feel I would be a great fit at Mozilla.

For a more complete profile of the projects I work on, jobs I've had,
and other details please see my resume. I have included it along
with this cover letter, it is also available on Read the Docs at
